# Jarvis
Python - Sample Project
"Jarvis" - Desktop Voice Assistant. You have heard about Siri or Alexa but we don't have the convenience of using them on the Desktop. However, cortana seems to be a much needed solution there but what if you need your voice assistant to be personalized or customized as per your needs? Jarvis does that for you.

This project is developed using technologies such as 'Python' and it keeps on getting more personalized by using Artificial Intelligence as it's Input Engine.

Jarvis lets you easily perform various tasks on your computer and that too with the help of Voice Inputs - Gone are the days when you actually have to manually enter and select what to do.

Sample keywords to use:

Jarvis - Open YouTube
Jarvis - Send an email to Priyanshu
Jarvis - Play a song for me
Jarvis - Open Google
It is a sample project, however, you can configure Jarvis for yourself by adding infinite queries based on the actions that you want it to perform.
